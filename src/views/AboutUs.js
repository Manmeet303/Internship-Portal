                                                    recruiting system. They quit

                                                    There's this notion that to
                                                    grow a business, you have to
                                                    be ruthless. But we know
                                                    there's a better way to
                                                    grow. One where what's good
                                                    for the bottom line is also
                                                    good for customers. We
                                                    believe businesses can grow
                                                    with a conscience, and
                                                    succeed with a soul — and
                                                    that they can do it with
                                                    inbound. That's why we've
                                                    created an ecosystem uniting
                                                    software, education, and
                                                    community to help businesses
                                                    grow better every day.
